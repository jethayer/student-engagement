## Explainable Records
### Record 1
**Raw Data:**  
k010	t04	5P	8.9	[ 8.0,10.2)	male	0.8	3.357	0.786	0	3.357	1.5	0.357	0.08925	0.26775	0	0.5	4.5	12	4.5	9.857	0.125	0.555555556	0.181191032	0	7	10	34	0.066666667	1	0.25	37	31	1.103448276	0.031547619	0.010869565	0.372	0.015	0.88	1.6555	0.034482759	0.066666667

**Prediction Explanation:**  
0.03623664 - This prediction is correct in terms of the domain as it is is representative  
of the students response time (the value of d2_rt).

### Record 2
**Raw Data:**  
k014	t02	7P	10.5	[10.2,11.2)	male	0.7	0.5	0.786	0.5	0.5	0.5	1.929	1.929	0	0.5	0.786	1.5	5	8.5	6.001	1.6	1.647058824	1.619063489	0.67	4	12	42	0.366666667	0.357142857	0.55	35	12	0.730593607	0.035714286	0.018403482	0.351	0.0425	0.84	1.228	0.138888889	0.075

**Prediction Explanation:**  
0.03294404 - This prediction is correct in terms of the domain becuase the student testing  value of 0.625 seconds would have a predicted value in this range. It makes sense for the  error rate to correlate with a response times of this speed. The actual value is 0.039732940364463135.
  
## Interesting Features
### Feature A
**Feature:**  
Sleep Score

**Justification:**  
Sleep is an important factor affecting various aspects of cognitive and motor performance.

### Feature B
**Feature:**  
Age

**Justification:**  
Age plays a significant role in cognitive development and performance.  
Different age groups exhibit variations in attention span, reaction times, and cognitive abilities.

## Experiments 
### Varying A
**Prediction Trend Seen:**  
Those with less sleep on average had more errors and were slower to respond.

### Varying B
**Prediction Trend Seen:**  
Those with a greater age had a higher motor performance overall regardless of error correlation.

### Varying A and B together
**Prediction Trend Seen:**  
A and B together saw the greatest trend in error rate. if a participant got more sleep  
and was older then they had lower errors overall. This correlation is not as strong when the two are not separate.  
  
### Varying A and B inversely
**Prediction Trend Seen:**  
Participants who got less sleep but are older had slower times in correlation to error rate  in comparison to those who are younger and got a lot of sleep. This shows sleep is a  greater determining factor on error rate and attention span than age.
