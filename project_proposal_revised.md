#### Keywords:  
Social Media, attention span, attention deficit  
  
#### Description:  
A study and analyzation of the impact of social media on the attention span of users; primarily those from a youger demographic. Does social  
media have a significant impact on focus and attention span? How strong is the correlation, if any, between social media and attention span?  
This topic and these questions are feasible as they can be tested, measured, and compared within the allotted time by sourcing data from studies 
of performance in school and attention in comparison to frequecny of social media usage.  
  
#### Research Objectives:  
RO1: To describe the trends within focus and academic performance in correlation with media usage.  
  
RO2: To predict the focus and academic scores and values based on media usage.  
  
RO3: To defend the prediction of focus and academic scores/values in RO2.  
  
RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by academic scores and values based on media usage in RO2.  
  
#### Intellectual Merit:  
Generations contemporaneous with the rise of social media and the age of information are considered ultramodern. Studies on the attention span 
of society are becoming more frequent in correlation to the prevalence of social media. Data on youth is even more seldom making this a new  
field of discovery, yet easily explorable to study and anzalyze. In this project studies will be replicated and their data will be used to  
perform new comparisons through correlation abd regression analysis. Understanding the potential correlations of social media and attention span 
will enable the general public to make informed decisions regarding media usage which is why these studies are necessary.   
  
#### Data Sourcing:  
The primary methodology that will be used for retrieving data is secondary data analysis i.e. data from existing data sets that were gathered   
through tests, surveys, and questionnaires. Since the data for this project is both new and scarce, additional data may be collected through   
direct surveys and or web scraping. Some sites and data sets are:
